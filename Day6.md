## Data Fetching & Promises
  - APIs provide URL that point to certain resource (data)
  - fetch() use to load data from APIs

### Promises  
promises represent the value that don't have yet promises take time so its asynchronous ,JS add this task to list and keep running code but if we need data from promise, can stop JS execute and wait to for promise to resolve.

fetch() take time to get data because its return a promise

promises states
  1. pending: still waiting, I promise to get value
  2. fulfilled: get the value
  3. reject: can't get the value
     
await keyword stop JS and wait to finish asynchronous operation
