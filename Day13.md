## Types
in JS everything is object is false, the true is in JS most things are object. 

in JS variables don't have types, value do 

typeof operator return string that indicate the type 

null in typeof operator return 'object' is bug 

### undefined vs undeclared vs uninitialized
1. undefined means there is a variable but at the moment  has no value.
2. undeclared means never been created.
3. uninitialized means have a variable never be initialized (not allow to touch these variable).
