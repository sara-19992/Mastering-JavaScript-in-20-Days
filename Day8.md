## JavaScript Principles

### Thread of execution
- line by line execution the code
- JS single execution one line executed at once time

### Memory
- save the data to use it.
- save function code in memory to use it by call the function name with ().

### Execution Context
to run code of a function when call it by name & ().

### Call Stack
JS tracking a function running by call stack (global stack), push the run function to stack and when finish execute this function pop it from stack (delete it), the top of stack represent the function running now.

### Function
- when function execute create a new local memory (variable enviroment/state) and when finish execute it deleted.
- make function reusable.
- genrlization the function.
- function in JS is object (what do in object doing with function, assign it tovarible, return it from function).
- arrow functtion is shorthand way to save funtion added in ES6 (make code pretty, egibility)

### Heigher Order Function
heigher order function means function take in a function
callback fuction means the function we insert it

### Nested function scope
- if we not find valrable in function local memory go to outer function and search on it.

### CLousre
cloure (backpack) pring the data with the function gose, ull the data around the function and push it
where my function saved
