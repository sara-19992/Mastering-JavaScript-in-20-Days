## Advanced Scope

### Lexical scope vs Dynamic scope
**Lexical scope** is scope of a variables or functions based on where it is defined in the code.
**Dynamic scope** is scope where functions is called. 

### Blcok scope
scope done with blocks by curly braces.

### Hoisting
JS move variable and function declaration to the top of scope before executing. and hoisting sometimes bad / sometimes useful. 

**function hoisting**
1. call function before their declaration.
2. function hoisting is useful to put the executable code at the top.
3. unction expression not hoisted.
   
**variable hoisting**   
1. variable hoisting can use them before declare
2. var, const are hoisted and assigned to undefined.
7. let is hoist and not initialize, can't touch it like var and const.
